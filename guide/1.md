## Welcome to AWS NGINX Meetup – From Application code to Customers

Delivering modern applications has upped the needs to provide agile application services free from infrastructure constrains, while ensuring applications run faster, secured and at scale. Choosing the right architecture for application services allows organizations to innovate faster and role new services on any infrastructure or cloud architecture. 
From code development to customer consumption, NGINX deployed on AWS is helping millions of organizations deliver application infrastructure and services ensuring their application are fast, secure and run at scale.

#### [Intro to the workshop](2intro.md) 
 
In this workshop you will experience how to deploy your application in an agile way, using NGINX Controller utilizing AWS compute, applying all the application services needed, such as load balancing, API management and application firewall in a fully automated way.  
 
#### [Deploy NGINX infrastructure using Terraform](3tf.md)

Start by using automation and use Infrastructure as Code concepts to deploy the environment.
 
#### [Deploy your application with NGINX Unit Application Server](4unit.md)
Easley manage your application deployment lifecycle with the Nginx Unit Application Server
 
#### [Increase availability, security and application performance with Kubernetes Nginx Ingress](5ingress.md)
1.	Onboard with Caching and Load Balancing
Deliver your application faster, using caching and compression to free application resources and improve user’s experience
2.	Intro to OpenTracing benefits 
Open Tracing provides the ability to monitor and resolve issues much faster when your application architecture becomes more complex
3.	Zero Trust - Applying Mutual TLS authentication  
Applying mutual TLS authentication with NGINX 
 
 
#### [The Nginx Controller](6controller.md)
1.	Publish the application APIs with NGINX Micro Gateway
Deploy and publish your API endpoints with NGINX Micro Gateway within your Kubernetes environment
2.	Enhance APIs with JWT or Access Key token authentication
Offload API authentication processes to your API gateway and concentrate 
3.	Apply API rate limit and spike arrest 
Protect your APIs from abuse and enforce monetization controls 
4.	Monitor your application performance
Discover your application performance, understand and react when application SLAs are impacted
 
#### [Security](7security.md)
Secure you application with Nginx App Protect Web Application Firewall.           
Protect you application from fraudulent interactions and separate legitimate traffic from unwanted one with Nginx App Protect Web Application Firewall.
